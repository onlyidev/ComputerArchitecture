# What this is
This is my lab work for Computer Architecture course (1st semester, Software Engineering, VU)

# What to expect
All lab projects are written in YASM

# What are the lab projects?
Lab projects are certain tasks provided by lecturers. You can usually find a pdf file in a folder Lab# that describes the task.
Generally, the projects here show my progress and are __not__ solutions to real world problems.
